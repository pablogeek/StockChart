## Architecture

The architecture is MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel).

MVVM is an architecture pattern used in software development to separate the user interface (UI) from the business logic of an application. The MVVM pattern has become increasingly popular in recent years.

It is specially important to implement the right architecture also for testing purposes.

## Libraries

It integrates two libraries:

- SwiftUICharts: Open-source library for creating customizable and interactive charts and graphs in SwiftUI
- SwiftYFinance: Open-source library for fetching financial data from Yahoo Finance in Swift
